# Selective

Selective is a library for making long, unwieldy select boxes more user
friendly.  The design and a large amount of the code is a direct port of Chosen
(http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen).

- jQuery support: 1.6+

For documentation, usage, and examples, see:

### Credits

- Based on Chosen, which was built by [Harvest](http://www.getharvest.com/)
- Design and CSS (from Chosen) by [Matthew Lettini](http://matthewlettini.com/)
